# GitHub MCP Custom (Cross-Platform NPX Wrapper)

A custom-packaged version of the [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) that runs seamlessly on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS** via `npx`. This wraps the Go binary in a Node.js launcher so developers using Claude Desktop can use GitHub MCP capabilities with no Docker or manual compilation required.

---

## 📦 Why This Exists

The official GitHub MCP Server requires:
- Docker or
- Manual Go compilation.

These options work well on Linux/macOS, but **break or complicate Windows usage**.

This package makes the server available via `npx`, eliminating the need for:
- Docker
- Go installation
- Custom PATH setups

---

## 🧠 What This Package Does

- Provides a cross-platform `github-mcp-custom` command
- Executes the prebuilt Go binary via Node.js wrapper
- Fully NPX-compatible on all OSes
- Works out-of-the-box with Claude Desktop or other MCP-compatible tools
- **Protocol version compatible with Claude Desktop**

---

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### 🔹 Option 1: Run with NPX (Recommended)

```bash
npx -y github-mcp-custom@1.0.20 stdio
```

> First-time use will download the package and run it automatically.

### 🔹 Option 2: Install Globally

```bash
npm install -g github-mcp-custom@1.0.20
github-mcp-custom stdio
```

### 🔹 Option 3: Direct Executable (Windows Fallback)

If NPX has issues on Windows, use the direct path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\github-mcp-custom\\dist\\github-mcp-server.exe",
      "args": ["stdio"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `[USERNAME]` with your actual Windows username.

**Note:** Use `@1.0.20` or later for optimal Claude Desktop compatibility.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v14 or later must be installed
- An active GitHub Personal Access Token with proper scopes:
  - `repo` (for repository access)
  - `read:org` (for organization access)
  - `user` (for user information)

---

## 🔐 Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select these scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` - Full control of private repositories
   - ✅ `read:org` - Read org and team membership
   - ✅ `user` - Update user data
4. Copy the generated token

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ "Server disconnected" in Claude Desktop**
- Ensure you're using version `1.0.20` or later
- Check that your GitHub token is valid and has proper scopes
- Verify the JSON configuration is valid (no trailing commas)

**❌ "Command not found"**
- Make sure Node.js is installed and in your PATH
- Try running `npm --version` to verify npm is working

**❌ "Authentication failed"**
- Verify your GitHub Personal Access Token is correct
- Check that the token has the required scopes (`repo`, `read:org`, `user`)
- Make sure the token hasn't expired

**❌ "Method not found" errors**
- Update to the latest version: `npm install -g github-mcp-custom@latest`

## 👷 How This Was Built

1. Cloned the official GitHub MCP Server repository.
2. Updated protocol version for Claude Desktop compatibility.
3. Compiled Go binaries for all platforms:
   ```bash
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/github-mcp-server-linux ./cmd/github-mcp-server
   GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/github-mcp-server-macos ./cmd/github-mcp-server  
   GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/github-mcp-server.exe ./cmd/github-mcp-server
   ```
4. Created a Node.js wrapper script (`bin/index.js`) for cross-platform execution.
5. Set up NPM-compatible `package.json` with proper bin configuration.
6. Published the package with protocol compatibility fixes.
